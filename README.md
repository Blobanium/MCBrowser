# MCBrowser

This is still a WIP. Expect Bugs.

REQUIRES [MCEF](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcef) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) (For 0.0.3-Beta+ only)

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) isn't required because MCEF already includes the fabric libraries we depend on. But however it is recomended that you install it. (Its required for versions 0.0.2-Beta and prior OR it says you need `fabric-command-api-v2` and/or `fabric-lifecycle-events-v1`)

type `/browser` or `/br` to open the browser.
