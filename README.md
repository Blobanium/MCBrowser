# MCBrowser

This is still a WIP. Expect Bugs.

REQUIRES [MCEF](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcef/files/4802415) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

type `/browser` or `/br` to open the browser.

Known issues:
- Doing CTRL-A also in the URL Box also selects everything in the browser.
- You Can't Sign in with Google. (https://github.com/CinemaMod/mcef/issues/61)
